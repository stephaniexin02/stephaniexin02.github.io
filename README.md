Our task in this assignment is to build a working implementation of the front-end component of the website you designed in Assignment 2. 
The website is written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and does not have to include a working back-end (e.g. database, app server, API server, etc.) or make use of any front-end framework.

Website designed:
The website that I re-designed was for a Book store, "COOK AND YOUNG BOOKSELLERS".
